## How the Kanban Board Works:

1. **Columns and Tasks:**
   - The board consists of columns representing different stages of a workflow (e.g., "Todo," "Doing," "Done").
   - Each column contains tasks relevant to that stage.
   - Users can create, edit, and delete both columns and tasks.

2. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:**
   - Tasks can be moved between columns using drag-and-drop functionality.
   - Columns can also be rearranged to customize the workflow.

3. **Task Details:**
   - Each task displays its content and due date.
   - Users can edit task content and due dates directly on the board.

4. **Dynamic User Interface:**
   - The UI is designed to be responsive and interactive.
   - Users can add new columns and tasks dynamically.

5. **Persistence:**
   - The application retains its state, even after a page refresh.
   - Tasks and columns are stored in the component state and can be saved to a backend server for persistent data storage.

### Technologies Used:

1. **React:**
   - The application is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
   - React's component-based architecture helps in creating modular and reusable UI elements.

2. **DND-Kit:**
   - The drag-and-drop functionality is implemented using the DND-Kit library.
   - DND-Kit provides a set of utilities for building drag-and-drop interfaces, making it easier to implement the Kanban board's interactive features.

3. **React-DatePicker:**
   - The React-DatePicker library is used for handling date selection in tasks.
   - It provides a user-friendly date picker component to set due dates for tasks.

4. **React-Portal:**
   - React Portals are utilized to render the drag overlay outside the normal document flow.
   - This is crucial for providing a seamless drag-and-drop experience across different parts of the page.

5. **TypeScript:**
   - TypeScript is used to enhance code quality and maintainability by adding static typing to the JavaScript code.

### Why This Approach:

1. **React for Component-Based UI:**
   - React's component-based structure simplifies UI development, making it easier to manage state and update the DOM efficiently.

2. **DND-Kit for Drag-and-Drop:**
   - DND-Kit abstracts away the complexities of drag-and-drop implementation, providing a clean API for handling draggable elements.

3. **React-DatePicker for Date Handling:**
   - React-DatePicker offers a straightforward solution for handling date input, enhancing the user experience for setting due dates.

4. **React-Portal for Overlay:**
   - React Portals enable rendering components outside their parent hierarchy, a crucial feature for creating the drag overlay in this Kanban board.

5. **TypeScript for Type Safety:**
   - TypeScript adds a layer of type safety to the code, reducing potential runtime errors and improving code maintainability.

In summary, the Kanban board is built with a combination of React and specialized libraries to provide a smooth and interactive task management experience. The use of TypeScript enhances code quality, and the chosen technologies contribute to a scalable and maintainable application.
